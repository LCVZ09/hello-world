# hello-world
Hello World! This is my fresh start on Github.

Call me Lanz, I'm still a student at Mapua. I want to expand my knowledge about coding, and that's why I'm here. I'm a Computer Engineering student. Although we're only limited to advanced programming and machine languages, I want to learn more about softwares and stuffs.

This Github account will be used to create an account for freeCodeCamp. The purpose of this account is to have all the files, I will use while learning there, uploaded here in Github. When I'm skilled enough to code and create my own projects, Github will be the perfect site for me.

Hello World! This is my fresh start on Github.

Call me Lanz, I'm still a student at Mapua. I want to expand my knowledge about coding, and that's why I'm here. I'm a Computer Engineering student. Although we're only limited to advanced programming and machine languages, I want to learn more about softwares and stuffs.
